# NewCharacterSheet
Are you new to D&D and just want a character sheet to start playing? Are you a burnt out DM that either needs a NPC to kill off or something for a drunken dread session? 

This _might_ be the program for you!!

This program will generate a level 1 base game character. Character will come with randomized stats (roll 4d6 and drop the lowest), feats, inventory, and attacks all ready to go!

All you need to do is give them a name and some personality traits (if you want). 


Future Plans:
+ Print the character sheet as a word doc
+ Possibly find a way to overwrite on a character sheet pdf with fillable text slots? 
+ Finish writing the campaign I keep putting off.......
